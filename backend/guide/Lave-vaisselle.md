# Dishwasher Not Draining  

## Introduction  

While dishwashers are as prone to part failure as other devices, they also require regularly scheduled maintenance. Refer to your owner's manual and this troubleshooting guide to get your machine running.  

Before replacing electrical components or hoses, consider disconnecting the electrical and draining the water supplies to the dishwasher. This will look like flipping the related breaker to the off position or removing its fuse, then locating the water supply for the dishwasher and closing the valve.  

### Dishwashing Tips  
Your dishwasher was designed to run with a dishwasher-compatible soap and will periodically need cleaning. Performing a routine dishwasher cleaning will help keep dishes clean.  

---

## Causes  

### 1. Incomplete Wash Cycle  

Check to make sure the last wash cycle completed properly‚Äîif your dishwasher has a **"Clean"** indicator light, it should be illuminated. If not, the wash cycle may have been interrupted. Close the door and press the **Start** button.  

#### Reset Dishwasher  
- Search in your user manual or online to find reset procedures for your device.  
- Holding the **start** button for five seconds may start a reset and drain cycle.

# Dishwasher Stops Mid Cycle

## Introduction
The dishwasher started its cycle just fine, then suddenly ended without warning. The similar issue of dishwasher not starting is worth checking out, as the causes are often the same.

## Causes

### 1. Heating Element Failure
The heating element is used to heat the water and dry the dishes. Premature failure can cause a dishwashing cycle to end. Visually inspect the element in the bottom of your machine for any bubbling or cracking. Test the heating element for continuity. It should read between 0-50 Ohm (Œ©). Replace if it fails the test.

### 2. Defective Drain or Circulation Pump
A new drain pump should only take a few minutes to remove all water from your dishwasher. Taking longer to remove the water or leaving standing water in the machine is a sign of a bad pump. Low humming or squealing noises also point to a pump problem. Pumps can fail both electrically and mechanically. Some models of dishwashers may have separate pumps to drain and circulate the water, so check both pumps. These pumps are normally on the bottom of your dishwasher.

If your dishwasher adds water, heats, and empties water, but the dishes are not clean then the circulation pump is likely the issue.

#### Mechanical
Let's listen to our dishwasher.

- A loud buzzing noise indicates a blocked or dirty drain pump or wash pump. If the pump is jammed, remove the blockage. You may have to replace the drain pump if there are no blockages.
- A squealing or droning suggests a failing wash pump. Search for blockages to the pump, and replace the wash pump.
- A scraping sound suggests a damaged impeller or impeller fin scraping against the pump housing. The impeller is inside of the pump and is what moves the water through the system. Replacing the impeller instead of the whole pump may be possible. Inspect the impeller. If it's broken, replace it.
- A worn drain pump may also have a hole, crack, or worn bearings causing a leak. Replace the drain pump in this case.

#### Electrical
If none of the above tones are evident, then disconnect the drain pump from the system, and test its continuity. If the measured impedance in Ohm (Œ©) between terminals is 15-40Œ©, your drain pump is likely fine.

If the pump just hums when it should be running, the entire pump assembly might need to be replaced.

### 3. Door Latch Failure
The door must be latched during the entire cycle. A defective door latch assembly may prevent the dishwasher from running when the door opens. Inspect the latch for any broken pieces or debris where the door makes contact.

The electronic switch may have failed as well. In some cases, the microswitch can be tested and replaced independently of the assembly. Test for continuity by depressing the switch. A resistance value outside of 0-1Œ© needs replacing.

**How To Use A Multimeter**
- Duration: 5 minutes
- Difficulty: Easy

### 4. Control Board Failure
The control board is responsible for every dishwasher operation. Before replacing the entire control board, verify that the screen and touchpad are working. Check the board for signs of burning or shorted-out components.

### 5. Timer Failure
Like the control board, the timer may have failed and need replacing. Inspect the board for signs of burning or shorted-out components.

# Dishwasher Not Drying
## Introduction
If your dishes are still dripping wet after a wash cycle, first check your dishwasher‚Äôs owner‚Äôs manual to make sure it‚Äôs being operated correctly. Many manufacturers recommend using a liquid rinse aid for proper drying performance. Additionally, if your home‚Äôs water temperature isn‚Äôt hot enough to begin with this can hinder drying performance‚Äîso adjust the temperature setting on your water heater if needed.

But if none of that helps, there may be an actual hardware issue with your dishwasher. In that case, check the following.

## Causes

### 1. Faulty Vent Door
Your dishwasher likely has a small motorized door or flap that‚Äôs supposed to open during the drying cycle in order to vent the steamy air out. Look around for the door and make sure it‚Äôs not damaged or obstructed. If necessary, replace it.

### 2. Faulty Vent Fan Motor
The vent fan blows the steamy air out of the aforementioned vent. If the vent door is opening properly but the fan motor has failed, most of the steamy air stays trapped in the dishwasher. Remove the fan motor and use a multimeter to test it for continuity. If there‚Äôs no continuity, replace the motor.

### 3. Faulty Heating Element
The heating element lies inside your dishwasher near the bottom, and helps get the water hot enough to turn it into steam so the aforementioned fan can blow it out and leave everything inside nice and dry. If the heating element fails, the water never gets hot enough to evaporate.

To check the heating element, run a wash cycle using the heated dry feature, and open the dishwasher door in the middle of the dry cycle. (Watch out, it may be very hot in there.) It should be steamy hot inside, and if you wave your hand over the heating element (without touching anything!), you should be able to feel the heat coming off it.

If there‚Äôs no heat, you may need to replace the heating element‚Äîtry removing it from the dishwasher and then use a multimeter to check the resistance of the heating element. It should measure somewhere in the range of 8-30 ohms. If resistance is infinite, replace the heating element.

### 4. Faulty Support Components for Heating Element
If the heating element checks out, you may have a heating element wiring failure, thermostat failure, limit switch failure, or control board failure.

Unplug the power to the dishwasher and shut off the water supply, disconnect the drain plug (remembering to use a drain pan), disconnect the water supply (use that pan again), and pull the dishwasher out from the wall. Disassemble the dishwasher enough to check the wiring connections to the heating element and make sure they‚Äôre tight.

Check the wiring to the thermostat in the same way. Remove the thermostat and test it with a multimeter‚Äîresistance should measure near zero ohms. If not, replace the thermostat.

Your dishwasher may also have a limit switch, which is a safety feature designed to switch off the heating element if it gets too hot. If the switch fails, the heating element may not turn on at all. Remove the switch and test it for continuity; if it fails, replace it.

If none of that helps, you may need to replace the electronic control board for the heating element.

# Dishwasher Leaking

## Introduction
There's water in your kitchen, and it's definitely coming from the dishwasher. Use this troubleshooting guide to determine where the water is overflowing and get the machine running again.

## First Steps
It's important to perform regular fridge maintenance before trying these fixes. Your appliance should last for at least 10-15 years before needing replacement, so keep it running well with these dishwasher maintenance tips.

## Causes

### 1. Incorrect Washing Fluid
Make sure your detergent is intended for dishwashers. Do not use liquid dish soap. Also, using too much detergent can cause flooding of the wash chamber.

### 2. Clogged Filter
A clogged filter will not allow water to drain, and the water will need to find another way to spill out. This usually results in water leaving through the door seals and accumulating under the appliance.

Inspect and clean your filter regularly.

### 3. Dishwasher Not Level
If your dishwasher wasn't installed on a level surface, then water can attempt to escape through any number of screws or rivets.

Verify the level on newly installed machines.

### 4. Cracked or Loose Wash Arm Assemblies
If the wash arm is cracked, a stream of water can spray the door seal and cause a leak. Inspect and replace the wash arm if there is a crack. Do not fix the crack with glue as the glue will break down inside the machine. Epoxy will work as long as it can handle the internal run temperatures (120¬∞F - 180¬∞F).

If the wash arm is intact, check that the support screws are tight. Looseness may allow water spray between the wash arm support and the pump housing, and thus another leak.

### 5. Faulty Water Inlet Valve
The inlet valves allow water to enter the dishwasher. When clogged or failing, either not enough water will enter the machine for a proper cleaning cycle to run, or the machine will continue filling with water until a leak or overflow occurs. If you're experiencing these issues, the water inlet valve may be at fault.

Since the valve can fail both electrically and mechanically, test its continuity. Continuity confirms that an electrical path is present, and what its resistance value is. If the water inlet valve continuity tests at around 500-1500Œ©, then it's likely fine. If it tests Overload (OL) or off the charts, it needs replacing.

After verifying electrical continuity, turn off hot and cold water supplies to the dishwasher. Then, disconnect the water supplies to the inlet valve and hold the hoses over a sink or water basin, or bucket. Turn the water supplies on and see that water is flowing strongly at a reasonable pressure between 20-120 psi and not dribbling out. A low pressure and weak flow suggests issues with the water supply lines or valves. If the flow is strong, remove the valve and fill hose, and replace it with a new water inlet valve.

**Note:** Do not attempt simply cleaning and replacing a clogged valve as this part is likely to fail after disassembly.

### 6. Clogged Float Assembly or Defective Fill Switch
The float valve is located near the front of the machine, and signals when it's time for the dishwasher to stop filling. Food can accumulate under this valve and is worth inspecting and cleaning. On Bosch machines, this looks like an E15 code.

Remove the valve. Most valves can be removed by pulling straight up.
Unclog any food in or around the valve.
Underneath the machine is a lever that the valve moves which triggers a switch. This switch stops filling the machine with water. If this switch is faulty, the machine may either not fill with water or will not stop filling with water.

Additionally, the switch's lever may fall out of place and need replacing.

Test the continuity of the switch with a multimeter. It should read close to 0Œ© in the closed position and OL in the open position. If it doesn't read these values, replace the switch.

This is not to be confused with a tripped safety switch, where water is dripping beneath the appliance.

### 7. Worn Seals and Lines
There are many seals on a dishwasher. You can narrow the source of the leak and check the corresponding seals, and replace as necessary.

- If water leaks from the door, check the door seal. If the seal looks fine, check the door hinges. Bent hinges will prevent the door from closing and allow water to leak.
- Door seals will dry up or have excessive buildup where they meet the device. Clean seals and mating surfaces with a diluted vinegar wash.
- If water leaks from the motor area, check the motor shaft seal. On some machines, the entire pump and motor assembly must be replaced.
- If water leaks from pump area, inspect the seals for the main tub, float, heating element and blower diffuser.
- If water leaks from the drain hoses, check hose clamps and cracks in the hose. Replace hoses as necessary.
- If water leaks from the supply line, tape again with teflon (PTFE) tape, or replace old lines.

### 8. Faulty Diverter Motor or Diverter Seal
The diverter motor aligns the diverter disc so the disc can direct water through the upper spray arms. If the diverter motor fails, the dishwasher will stop and throw an error code. The seal is the gasket around the diverter motor shaft where it meets the bottom of the sump. A leak will damage the motor and leak beneath the machine.

Safely uninstall the dishwasher and tilt it on its back.
Remove the diverter motor and seal. The shaft may be worn which caused the seal failure and leakage. Inspect the switch printed circuit board (PCB) inside for corrosion, and replace if necessary to prevent future seal failure.
Consider applying clear nail polish, conformal coating spray, silicone, or RTV to waterproof the board during installation.
Install a new diverter motor and seal. Lubricate the seal and diverter shaft with plumber's silicone faucet lube.
Replace the red wire diverter connector. If it's corroded and not replaced, the diverter will spin continuously and result in early seal failure.

### 9. Defective Drain or Circulation Pump
A new drain pump should only take a few minutes to remove all water from your dishwasher. Taking longer to remove the water or leaving standing water in the machine is a sign of a bad pump. Low humming, grinding, or squealing noises also point to a pump problem. Pumps can fail both electrically and mechanically. Some models of dishwashers may have separate pumps to drain and circulate the water, so check both pumps. These pumps are normally on the bottom of your dishwasher.

If your the dishwasher adds water, heats, and empties water but the dishes are not clean, then the circulation pump is likely the issue.

#### Mechanical
Let's listen to our dishwasher.

- A loud buzzing noise indicates a blocked or dirty drain pump or wash pump. If the pump is jammed, remove the blockage. You may have to replace the drain pump if there are no blockages.
- A squealing or droning suggests a failing wash pump. Search for blockages to the pump, and replace the wash pump.
- A scraping sound suggests a damaged impeller or impeller fin scraping against the pump housing. The impeller is inside of the pump and is what moves the water through the system. Replacing the impeller instead of the whole pump may be possible. Inspect the impeller. If it's broken, replace it.
- A worn drain pump may also have a hole, crack, or worn bearings causing a leak. Replace the drain pump in this case.

#### Electrical
If none of the above tones are evident, then disconnect the drain pump from the system, and test its continuity. If the measured impedance in Ohm (Œ©) between terminals is 15-40Œ©, your drain pump is likely fine.

If the pump just hums when it should be running, the entire pump assembly might need to be replaced.

# Dishwasher Soap Pods Not Dissolving

## Introduction
Soap pods not dissolving can be incredibly frustrating. Follow the steps below to work through the most likely causes and culprits.

## Causes

### 1. Incorrect Cycle Selection
Different wash cycles operate at different temperatures.

- Select the appropriate wash cycle for your detergent.

### 2. Water Temperature Too Low
Additionally, your water temperature may be too low. Dishwasher pods are designed to dissolve and activate at specific water temperatures.

- Run your sink hot water before a dish load to keep the cycle to temperature.
- Verify your sink hot water is set to the dishwasher manufacturer's recommended level, usually between 120¬∞F-140¬∞F (49¬∞C-60¬∞C).
- If it's too low, increase the temperature on your water heater.

### 3. Operator Error

#### Overloading the Dishwasher
If you overload the dishwasher with too many dishes or overcrowd the utensil holder, it can obstruct the water flow and prevent the pod from dissolving properly.

- Load the dishwasher according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Leave enough space for the water to circulate freely.

#### Incorrect Pod Placement
Improper placement of the dishwasher pod can also affect whether it can fully dissolve. Most dishwashers have a dispenser or separate pod dispenser in the main wash compartment.

- Place the pod in the correct compartment.

#### Dishes Pre-Washed
If you rinse your dishes before placing them in the dishwasher, the soap pod may not dissolve properly because it's designed to work with food particles.

- Wipe most of the food off dishes, but leave enough residue for the soap pod to interact with the dirty dishes as intended.
- Pre-rinsing wastes a lot of water.

### 4. Faulty Dispenser or Dispenser Blockage

#### Faulty Dispenser
The detergent dispenser in your dishwasher may be faulty or malfunctioning. If the pod is not opened or released appropriately during the wash cycle, the pod won't dissolve as intended.

- Inspect the dispenser for damage or obstructions.
- Replace if necessary.

#### Dispenser Blockage
The detergent dispenser could be blocked or clogged, preventing the pod from releasing properly during the wash cycle.

- Check the dispenser for debris, residue, or obstructions, and clean thoroughly.

### 5. Poor Detergent Quality, Old or Expired Pods, Improper Pod Storage

#### Poor Detergent Quality
Different dishwasher detergents may have varying abilities to dissolve and clean.

- View a list of reviewed soap pods and purchase one proven to clean, or try another brand.

#### Old or Expired Pods
Dishwasher pods have a shelf life. They may lose their effectiveness and fail to dissolve properly when old or expired.

- Check the expiration date on the packaging, and use fresh pods.

#### Improper Pod Storage
If you're storing your dishwasher pods in a humid or moist environment, they may absorb moisture and become clumpy, making them less likely to dissolve properly.

- Store the pods in a cool, dry place away from excessive moisture.

### 6. Water Supply Issues

#### Water is Too Hard
Hard water can interfere with the effectiveness of dishwasher pods. The minerals in hard water can form a film or residue on dishes, making it difficult for the soap pod to dissolve.

- Use a water softener or a dishwasher detergent specifically formulated for hard water.
- If you have a water softener system in your home, verify it functions.

#### Water Pressure Issues
Low water pressure could be affecting how much water is entering your dishwasher.

- Pull the machine away from the wall.
- Disconnect the water inlet valve from the water supply.
- Open the water supply valve and see if the pressure is at least 20 psi.
- Call a plumber if the water pressure seems low.

### 7. Faulty Spray Arm
If the dishwasher's spray arms or jets are clogged with food and other debris, the water may not reach the soap pod effectively, preventing it from dissolving.

- Inspect the spray arms and ensure they are free from debris or obstructions. Clean them if necessary.
- If there are cracks in the spray arms, replace them.

### 8. Circulation Pump Failure
The circulation pump moves water from the bottom of the dishwasher back up and through the spray arms. Water doesn't reach and dissolve the soap pod when this pump fails.

- Test the circulation pump by starting a cycle or initiating a diagnostic mode.
- Open the door after the water has filled, and see if water is dripping from the spray arms and if the spray arms are spinning.
- If there is a pool of water at the bottom of the dishwasher, your circulation pump is likely faulty. Remove and test the pump with a multimeter before replacing it.

### 9. Dishwashing Tips
Your dishwasher was designed to run with a specific soap and needs cleaning periodically. Performing a routine dishwasher cleaning will help it run in top shape.

# Dishwasher Smells Bad
## Introduction
## Causes
1. [Garbage Smell](#garbage-smell)
2. [Sewage and Mildew Smell](#sewage-and-mildew-smell)
3. [Burning Smell](#burning-smell)
4. [Dishwashing Tips](#dishwashing-tips)

## Introduction
It's only a matter of time until your dishwasher acquires an unpleasant odor. Trapped food scraps, grease and oil buildup, or standing water can cause bacteria growth and mildew. While we love the smell of clean dishes, we are less partial to an eggy or a burning smell. Let's get your dishwasher back to normal.

Another similar issue is a dishwasher not cleaning. If that problem is more applicable, try the solutions on that page instead.

## Causes

### Garbage Smell
**Dirty Drain Filter**
The filter lives at the bottom of the dishwasher and needs periodic emptying and cleaning. Remove and scrub the filter and screen with soap before replacing. Remove any other large chunks of food from the bottom of the machine.

**Food Particles in Soap Scum**
Soap scum can act as an adhesive for food particles. Running a cleaning cycle in your dishwasher with distilled white vinegar can neutralize the odors. Add two cups of white vinegar into a dishwasher safe bowl onto the bottom rack of the empty dishwasher. Let the machine air dry at the end of the cycle.

**Clogged Spray Arm**
The spray arm may have become clogged with food particles. Unclog the holes, and wash with soap. Make sure to clean both upper and lower spray arms. Check the spray arm gaskets and replace if necessary.

### Sewage and Mildew Smell
**Gasket Seals**
Mold and mildew can live in the folds of the constantly wet gasket seals. Inspect and clean these seals regularly, especially with the presence of an odor.

**Clogged or Kinked Drain Hose**
The drain hose transfers fluid from the bottom of your dishwasher to your garbage disposal or under sink drain connection. Solid debris ‚Äî food, hair, etc ‚Äî can accumulate in the drain hose with time, but clogs normally form with broken plastic, stickers or porcelain chips.

Check for a kink in the drain hose that runs from the bottom of your dishwasher to the drain pipe (usually below the sink). Make sure it‚Äôs not pinched or kinked. If necessary, replace it with a new hose.
Check for a clog. Remove the drain hose end from the nipple it's connected to below the sink or disposal, put the end in a bucket, then fill and drain the dishwasher to see if a garbage clog will simply blow out.
If that doesn't work, but you see a small dribble of water, you may have to pull the dishwasher out and remove the drain hose in order clean it out or replace it.
Remember, there's still water in the unit‚Äîso put a drain pan under it before removing the hose.
Remove the sump pump screen at the bottom of your dishwasher and remove any materials that shouldn't be there. This screen is usually held in by a couple of screws. Remove the coarse and fine filters and remove all foreign material.

**Clogged Air Gap Fitting**
After the drain hose leaves the bottom of the dishwasher the hose passes through a loop on the outside of the machine. The hose then travels to an air gap, check valve, or high loop under your sink before connecting to the garbage disposal or under sink drain connector.

Air gaps are a plumbing standard in some locations and optional in others. Check local codes if you're unsure. Without an air gap, there is a small possibility to syphon sewage contaminants into your drinking water system.

Check your air gap fittings at the sink for any obstructions.

### Burning Smell
**Plastic Close to Heating Element**
Some pieces of plastic should be run on top shelf only to avoid proximity heating. Additionally, your plastic dishes may have fallen from the top shelf mid-cycle. Pause the cycle and remove the plastic object.

**Heating Element**
A short circuit may have caused the burning smell. Check the heating element for blisters or raised sections, or if it snapped in half. A multimeter can be used to test continuity in Ohms (Œ©). If the meter reads between 0-50Œ©, the element has continuity. In the absence of continuity, replace the heating element.

**Control Board**
In the event of a power surge or component failure, the control board can short out. Inspect the board for burn marks, and replace if burnt.

**Power Cord**
Overheating cords can melt the coating on the wires. Verify connections on ends of wire are tight and haven't melted or burnt. In the event of damage, unplug machine and replace connections or cord.

### Dishwashing Tips
Your dishwasher was designed to run with a specific soap, and will periodically need cleaning. Performing a routine dishwasher cleaning will help it run in top shape.

# Dishwasher Melting or Warping Plastic Items
## Introduction
Some plastic items cannot be exposed to temperatures usually found in dishwashers without changing shape.

Once the plastic item has distorted, it cannot be returned to its original shape. To minimize or prevent plastic items from warping or melting:

- Choose the air-dry cycle to dry the dishes.
- Place plastic items on the top rack.
- Purchase and use plastic items that are labeled ‚Äúdishwasher-proof.‚Äù
