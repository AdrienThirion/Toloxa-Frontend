## Causes and Solutions

### 1. Stains on Clothing

#### Why It Happens?
- Washer component malfunctions or external sources.
- Synthetic fabrics and improper washing techniques.
- Invisible oil stains that attract dirt during washing.

#### How to Fix
- Treat stains promptly to prevent permanence.
- Use cold or warm water; hot water sets stains.
- Test stain removers on hidden areas first.
- Treat specific stains with the appropriate cleaners (e.g., enzyme presoaks for protein stains, dry-cleaning solvents for gum or oil-based stains).
- Follow chemical safety precautions (e.g., avoid mixing bleach and ammonia).

---

### 2. Yellowing in Fabric

#### Why It Happens?
- Inadequate removal of body soil.
- Hard water or mineral deposits.
- Accumulation of body oils on garments.

#### How to Fix
- Increase detergent use and wash at 150°F.
- Use bleach regularly to combat yellowing.
- Install a water-conditioning system for hard water issues.
- Pre-treat body oil stains before washing.

---

### 3. Fabric Softener Stains

#### Why It Happens?
- Fabric softeners added during the **wash cycle** instead of **rinse cycle**.

#### How to Fix
- Pretreat stains with liquid detergent.
- Wash the garment according to manual instructions.

---

### 4. Lint Problems

#### Why It Happens?
- Cotton fibers detaching from clothes.
- Overwashing accelerates wear and tear.

#### How to Fix
- Properly **sort laundry** (cotton vs. synthetic fabrics).
- Keep drain hose length under **10 feet** and height below **8 feet**.
- Inspect and clean the drain pump filter.

---

### 5. Washer Will Not Fill With Water

#### Why It Happens?
- Power supply issues.
- Mechanical faults.
- Obstructions in water flow.

#### How to Fix
- **Basic Checks**: Ensure the washer is plugged in and turned on.

- **Thorough Checks**: Inspect all components systematically.
- **Use a VOM**: Conduct accurate diagnostics for continuity testing.

# Washing Machine Won't Turn On

## First Steps
Before you go forward, here are a few questions to consider:

- Did you just run a very heavy load in your machine? You can have issues where the thermal protection for the motor trips after the motor has stopped. Give it a few minutes.
- Is your machine giving an error code? There are some codes that will prevent a machine from starting. Codes that deal with the door lock or draining the machine are good candidates for no start. Your owner's manual will help with those.
- Does the machine fill with water, but then nothing more? Obviously, you have power, and the start button works so that the machine will fill, so skip to **Child Lock**.
- Does the machine hum after it fills? Skip down to **Shorted Capacitor**.

---

## Causes

### 1. No Power
You might think we are kidding, but this is a common reason why your machine won't start. And it's easy to check.

#### Unplugged
Make sure it is plugged in. If it isn't, this will likely fix things. If not, go to **Tripped GFCI**.

#### Tripped GFCI
Many laundry areas may have Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) protected outlets. Sometimes those outlets can be tripped by certain conditions (like moisture) and they act dead. There are two buttons on the face of many of them, one marked **Test** and the other marked **Reset**.

- If your outlet where the washing machine is plugged in doesn't have those buttons, see if another outlet nearby does. If you don't find any, especially in an older home, go to **No Power at Outlet**, below.
- Unplug your washing machine. Push the button marked **Reset**. You may hear a faint click.
- Plug your machine in again.
- See if it starts. If it does, you are done! If not, go to the next item.

#### No Power at the Outlet
Make sure the outlet has power. Sometimes the circuit breaker can trip because another device was plugged in, like an electric heater or an electric clothes iron, and overloaded the circuit.

1. Use a lamp that you know works and see if it turns on. If it doesn't, then do the next item on this list.
2. Check the circuit breaker at the panel that feeds the outlet for the dryer.
   - It may be marked **Laundry**, for example, because your washer can share an outlet with a gas dryer. (Not an electric dryer)
3. Is it tripped or off? If so, turn it on.
4. Does your machine start now? All done!
5. No Go? Let's keep checking stuff.

---

### 2. Control Problems
No, not psychological ones, but your washing machine's controls. From the almost insulting to the tricky, we have:

#### The Start Button or Knob
Push the start button. Many machines need to be told to start even after you set a cycle. Many older machines with timers need the cycle knob pulled out to start.

#### Child Lock Is On
This can make your appliance just sit there when this is set, and not respond to any buttons you (or any children) push.

- Look carefully as often there may be a small light lit on the control panel, often like a baby or a smiling lock to tell you this is engaged. Some allow you to engage it when the cycle is running and it flashes **CL** (looks like an error code).
- Check your operating guide or owner's manual to find out more about the indicator and how to turn the lock off.
- If it is on, turn it off. You should be fine now.
- If your machine doesn't have it or it isn't turned on, go to the next item, **Broken Knobs or Shafts**, below.

#### Broken Knobs or Shafts
A knob may have come loose on the shaft so it doesn't turn it but you think you are doing so. This applies mainly to older machines with knobs that don't cause indications on a control panel display.

- Check all the knobs to make sure they are firmly on the shafts.
- Check the shafts to see that they are actually turning something and not just spinning uselessly.
- If these are all checking out, go on to the next item. If not, replace the knob or control as needed.

---

### 3. Lid Switch / Door Switch Failure
When your washing machine won't turn on, the most common component failure is probably the lid or door switch.

- Older, traditional top-load machines have a lid switch that simply lets the machine know the lid is shut. If the switch fails, many of these machines will not start their cycle. Some might fill with water but then they will stop.
- The switch on this type of machine can be checked for continuity with a multimeter set to Ohms or the Continuity function.
  - With the switch in the lid closed position, if it tests open (no continuity/or OL), it is defective and should be replaced.

---

### 4. Start Switch Failure
Older traditional machines use a switch built into the cycle timer knob that can fail.

- You can check the continuity of the switch with a multimeter.
- Look on the schematic (often included inside the washer control console) to see which contacts on the switch to check.
- If no continuity, replace the timer. This can be fairly costly.
- If you have continuity, go to the next item.

Newer machines generally use touch-style controls, and failures in these parts are much more difficult to diagnose. It may be that your **Motor Control Board** or **Control Board** has failed.

---

### 5. Shorted Capacitor
A failed capacitor will allow many non-motor functions to take place, including on some machines pumping out, but the drum or agitator won't move. A humming sound without any movement of the washing parts is a sign of a failed capacitor.

---

### 6. Worn Motor
You can use a multimeter to check the various contacts on the motor for continuity and proper resistance. As a rough guide, around 5-10 ohms is reasonable for most motor windings.

---

### 7. Faulty Motor Control Board
If you don't even get a hum but the machine might fill, check the **Motor Control Board**. This will usually be located close to the motor and be connected to it directly. Look for burnt components or signs of darkening on the board.

---

### 8. Faulty Control Board
A dead control board makes for a pretty much dead machine. On machines with electronic controls, the **Control Board** is the brains of the system. If your machine will do little and you have checked all these other items, your remaining fix is the **Control Board**.

# Washing Machine Not Spinning

## First Steps

For **High Efficiency (HE) machines**, refer to the solution directly under each possible cause. We will offer separate subheadings for **Top Loaders** and **Front Loaders** when the solutions differ.

If you've got an **older top loader machine** without a High-Efficiency badge, refer to the **"Traditional Machines"** sections, as these will cover older top loader machines mainly built before 2000. If there's no Traditional Machines section, just follow the main solution, as it doesn't differ from high-efficiency machines.

For the causes that follow, we assume:

- Your washing machine is **plugged in** and hasn't been accidentally unplugged. Check that it has power.
- If it doesn't even respond to start, **this isn't the right section**. Instead, troubleshoot why the machine won’t start at all.
- The machine is **able to fill with water**. If so, turn the water off for now.
- You ran a **Reset sequence** on your machine if it has electronic controls.

**Note:** If you replace a component on a machine with electronic controls, you should run a **reset and a calibration/recalibration**, if available. Otherwise, you may not clear the error.

---

## Causes

### 1. Lid Switch / Door Latch Problem

The lid or door must be **closed and locked** for the washer to operate.

#### Troubleshooting:
- If it won't lock, check the **strike** (the part that goes into the latch hole) for **damage** (bending or breakage).
- If the strike is intact, **replace the latch assembly**.
- The latch assembly is usually held by a few screws and can be accessed by removing the **top cover** (top loaders) or moving the **door gasket** (front loaders).
- Machines may give a **diagnostic error code** if there is a door switch or latch problem.
- Some top-load units allow a brief window at the cycle start to add clothes but require a **locked lid** to spin.

#### Traditional Machines:
- Older top loaders may **agitate with an open lid but won’t spin**.
- If it agitates when the lid is closed, the switch is working.
- Remove the **top of the machine** to access the **lid switch**.
- Check the **continuity** of the switch using a multimeter.
- If there’s **no continuity**, **replace the switch**.

If the switch is working, move on to the next cause.

---

### 2. Broken Belt / Loose Belt or Coupler Failure

Some machines use **drive belts** that can **slip, loosen, or break**.

#### Troubleshooting:
- **Check belt tension** (ensure the machine is unplugged).
- If the belt **slides easily on pulleys**, **replace it**.
- If the belt is **worn, cracked, or frayed**, **replace it**.
- On machines with **flat-style belts**, walk the belt off the pulleys to inspect it.
- If the belt is intact, move on to the next step.

#### Traditional Machines – Coupler Failure:
- Some Whirlpool, Roper, and Kenmore top loaders use a **plastic and rubber coupler** between the motor and transmission.
- Signs of failure:
  - **Cracked rubber parts** (pieces may be found under the machine).
  - **Plastic “spiders” cracked** or rounded out.
- To check:
  - Lay the washer on its **back**.
  - Disconnect the **pump** and **motor**.
  - Inspect the coupler and **replace if needed**.

If the belt and coupler are fine, proceed to the next cause.

---

### 3. Splutch and Shift Actuator or Clutch Failure

Newer top loaders use a **splutch system** (a combination of a clutch and pulley system).

#### Troubleshooting:
- Check if the **shift actuator** has failed or disconnected.
- Use a multimeter to test the **actuator motor**:
  - It should read between **2000-3500 ohms**.
  - If the actuator is **damaged or rusted**, **replace it**.
- Check if the **splutch lever** is properly engaging.
- If the actuator and splutch are working, move to the next item.

#### Traditional Machines – Clutch Failure:
- Older top-load washers use a **clutch** to allow gradual spin-up.
- Signs of a worn-out clutch:
  - **Slow spinning** or spinning only after **manual assistance**.
  - **Clothes remain too wet** after spinning.
  - **Loud banging noises** during spinning.
- If the clutch is **worn**, **replace the clutch band**.

---

### 4. Washing Machine Not Draining Fully

Most machines won’t spin if they haven’t drained properly.

#### Troubleshooting:
- **Manually drain** the washer and check if it will spin.
- Check for **clogged drain hoses** or **filters**.
- If the drain pump is **noisy or slow**, **replace it**.
- If the drain pump is working but it still won’t spin, move on to the next item.

---

### 5. Water Level System Failure

If the machine **incorrectly detects water levels**, it won’t spin.

#### Troubleshooting:
- Check the **water level sensor hose** for clogs.
- Blow through the hose to clear blockages.
- If the sensor does not **click** when pressure is applied, **replace it**.

---

### 6. Capacitor Failure

A **failed capacitor** may cause the washer motor to hum but not spin.

#### Troubleshooting:
- **Discharge the capacitor** before testing.
- Use a multimeter to test capacitance.
- If the capacitor **shows no charge**, **replace it**.

---

### 7. Tub Suspension Failure

If the **tub suspension is worn**, the washer may become unbalanced and not spin.

#### Top Loaders:
- Push the **basket down**.
- If it **bounces excessively**, the **suspension rods** need replacement.

#### Front Loaders:
- Check **shock absorbers**.
- If shocks are **leaking oil** or **worn out**, **replace them**.

---

### 8. Tub / Drum Bearing Failure

If the machine makes a **grinding noise**, the **bearings may be worn**.

#### Troubleshooting:
- Check for **excessive noise** while spinning.
- If the drum wobbles excessively, **replace the bearings**.

---

### 9. Motor Failure

If the motor **fails in one direction**, the machine won’t spin.

#### Troubleshooting:
- If the motor **hums but doesn’t run**, **check the windings**.
- If windings **don’t show continuity**, **replace the motor**.

---

### 10. Control Board or Motor Control Board Failure

If all components check out, the issue might be the **control board**.

#### Troubleshooting:
- If some cycles work but not spinning, suspect the **motor control board**.
- If the machine is completely unresponsive, check the **main control board**.
- If all else fails, **replace the control board**.

---

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you can troubleshoot and fix most **washing machine not spinning** issues. Start with **simple checks** like lid switches, belts, and drainage before considering **expensive repairs** like motor or control board replacements.

# Washing Machine Shaking

## First Steps
This shaking usually happens during the **spin cycle**.

- **Front-load machines** frequently try rearranging the load using partial rotations to redistribute it. Gravity helps them adjust automatically.
- **Top-load machines** do not have this advantage, so direct human intervention is often required.

If shaking or vibration happens **consistently** with almost every load, skip the **Load Unbalanced** section and start with **Leveling Legs**.

**Note:** The term **"Traditional" washing machines** refers to older top-load models with manual knobs that you pull out to start the cycle.

---

## Causes

### 1. Load Unbalanced
A common **user error** is loading the machine with **too many clothes** or **large single items** (e.g., a bedspread) that are not evenly distributed.

#### Troubleshooting:
- **Stop the machine**, open the door, and **rearrange the load**.
- If there’s only **one bulky item**, add a towel or another item to balance the load.
- If the load is too large, **remove some items** and try again.
- Refer to your **owner's manual** for proper load size recommendations.
- Restart the machine and check if it spins properly.

If the problem persists, move to the next cause.

---

### 2. Unlevel Legs
If your machine **rocks or moves** during the cycle, it may not be steady on its feet. This is especially important for **front-load washers**.

#### Troubleshooting:
- Try rocking the machine in different directions. If it moves, **leveling is needed**.
- Use a **level tool** on top of the machine to check if it is **even**.
- Adjust the **leveling legs** accordingly.
- Some machines have **self-leveling rear legs**. Tip the machine forward, then gently let it back down so the legs engage properly.
- If the mechanism is **rusted**, applying **lubricant** may help.
- Once leveled, restart the machine and check for improvements.

If the issue persists, continue troubleshooting.

---

### 3. Shipping Bolts Not Removed (Front Load Washers)

Shipping bolts **secure the washer drum** during transport. If they are not removed, the suspension remains locked, causing extreme vibrations.

#### Troubleshooting:
- Check the **back panel** for shipping bolts (typically **4 hex-head bolts with plastic washers**).
- If present, remove them with the provided **wrench** (or a standard wrench if missing).
- **Save the bolts** for future transport.

If shaking continues, move on to the next step.

---

### 4. Faulty Shock Absorbers (Front Load Washers)

Most **front-load washers** have **shock absorbers** to stabilize the drum. If they fail, the washer vibrates excessively.

#### Troubleshooting:
- Give the drum a **firm downward push**. If it **bounces more than once**, the shocks may be worn out.
- Remove the **front and rear panels** to inspect the **shock absorbers**.
- Look for **oil leaks** on the shock shafts (use a **clean paper towel** to check for oil residue).
- **Detach one end** of the shock absorber and **press it manually** – it should provide strong resistance.
- If **any shocks fail**, **replace all of them**.

If the shocks check out, move to **Springs**.

---

### 5. Suspension Rod Failure (Top Load Washers)

Top-load washers use **suspension rods** to stabilize the tub. Over time, these rods **lose tension**, allowing excessive movement.

#### Troubleshooting:
- Push down on the tub and release it quickly.
  - If it **bounces excessively**, the rods are **worn out**.
- **Apply damping grease** (e.g., Nyogel 767A) to improve suspension performance.
- If the **rods feel loose or wobbly**, **replace them**.

If the rods seem fine, move to **Spring Failure**.

---

### 6. Spring Failure

Washers have **suspension springs** that help stabilize the tub. If a spring **breaks or weakens**, the washer may vibrate excessively.

#### Troubleshooting:
- **Front-loaders**: Remove the **top cover** to check the **two suspension springs**.
- **Top-loaders**: Remove the **cabinet or side panels** to inspect **multiple springs**.
- Look for **broken, rusted, or detached springs**.
- If a spring is damaged, **replace all springs** to maintain balance.

If the springs are intact, proceed to **Suspension Wear Items**.

---

### 7. Suspension Wear Items Failed (Top Loaders)

Older **top-load washers** may use additional wear components like:
- **Snubber Rings**
- **Snubber Pads**
- **Damper Pads**
- **Skate Plates**

#### Troubleshooting:
- If the washer **bounces violently** during spin, these components may be worn.
- Disassemble the washer to inspect and **replace any worn parts**.
- If replacing the **snubber ring or pads**, ensure they are **installed correctly** to prevent further wear.

If your suspension is fine, move to **Spider Support Arm Failure**.

---

### 8. Spider Support Arm Failure

Applicable to **front and top loaders with Direct Drive motors**.

#### Troubleshooting:
- Rotate the **drum by hand** and listen for **clicking noises**.
- If the drum **wobbles excessively**, the **support arm** might be broken.
- Unfortunately, this repair is **complex and costly** – consider replacing the washer if it's old.

If the support arm is fine, check for **other causes**.

---

### 9. Other Causes

#### **Balance Ring Failure**
- Some top-load washers have a **liquid-filled balance ring** that **absorbs vibrations**.
- If the liquid **leaks**, the washer will vibrate excessively.
- **Check for leaks** and **replace the ring** if needed.

#### **Faulty Tub Bearings**
- **Failing bearings** cause **grinding noises and vibration**.
- **Inspect and replace** the bearings if they are worn.

#### **Direct Drive Motor Failure (Samsung Models)**
- Some **Samsung washers** have **rotor magnet issues** that cause excessive shaking.
- If you own a **Samsung direct drive washer**, check for **motor-related issues**.

#### **Worn Drive Block (Top Loaders)**
- The **drive block** connects the **agitator to the tub**.
- If it is **worn**, the agitator rattles, causing vibrations.
- Remove the **agitator** and inspect the drive block. **Replace if necessary**.

---

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can diagnose and fix most **shaking and vibration** issues in your washing machine. Start with **simple fixes** like checking the **load balance** and **leveling**, before moving on to more **complex repairs** like replacing **shock absorbers, springs, or suspension rods**.


# Washing Machine Not Draining

## First Steps

Your first move is to try to run a **drain and spin cycle**. If you don’t know how, consult your **owner’s manual**. If you don’t have one, visit the **manufacturer’s website** to download it.

### Initial Checks:
- Once the machine is **trying to drain**, check the following:
  - Is **water coming out of the drain hose**? Is it a full flow or just a trickle?
  - If no water is coming out, can you **hear the pump running**?
    - If it is **noisy** but not draining, there may be a **clog or impeller problem**.
- Some older **top loaders** use one motor for both the pump and the basket.
  - If the machine **spins but doesn’t drain**, the pump has likely failed.
- Check for **leaks**, which might indicate a **cracked pressure hose or air dome**.

### Draining the Machine Manually

You will need:
- A **bucket**
- A **shallow pan**
- Some **rags or towels**

#### **For Top Load Machines**
- Bail out as much water as possible using a **small container** and a large **bucket**.
- A **wet/dry vacuum** can help remove the remaining water.
- Open the **machine cabinet**, locate the **pump**, and disconnect the **hose** from the tub to the pump.
- Be ready with a **container to catch water**.

#### **For Front Load Machines**
- Most have a **drain filter** at the front bottom panel.
- Place a **shallow pan** under the drain filter, then slowly open it to allow water to drain.
- If no water comes out, move on to checking the **pump and hoses**.

Now, let’s look at the possible causes of the issue.

---

## Causes

### 1. Failed Pump

A non-draining washer is often due to a **pump failure**.

#### **How to Diagnose:**
- If the **pump motor doesn’t run**, check:
  - **Power connectors** – Ensure they are properly seated.
  - **Resistance of the motor winding** – Use a **multimeter** (should be between **10-40Ω**).
  - If resistance is **outside this range**, **replace the pump motor**.
- If the pump **runs but does not pump water**, check:
  - **Impeller** – It may be broken or loose.
  - **Clogs** – Small laundry items may block the pump.

#### **Steps to Fix:**
- **Remove debris** from the impeller.
- Check the **pump body** for lodged objects.
- If the **impeller is damaged**, **replace the pump motor**.
- Inspect wiring from the **pump to the control board** for continuity.

**For older top-loaders:**
- The **pump is often motor-driven**.
- If the motor **runs but does not pump**, the impeller may be jammed or the **drive connection may be broken**.
- Check if the **pump pulley is tight** if it is belt-driven.

---

### 2. Clogged Hoses

**If water is not draining, check the hoses.**

#### **How to Diagnose:**
- Remove the **drain hose from the standpipe**.
- Make sure the hose is **not inserted more than 4 inches (10 cm)** into the drain pipe.
- If the hose outlet is **higher than 8 feet**, reposition it.
- Detach the **drain hose from the washer** and check for **clogs**.
- Use a **dowel rod or plumber’s snake** to clear obstructions.

#### **For Tub-to-Pump Hose:**
- Remove the **pump** and inspect the **tub-to-pump hose**.
- Look for **lint, small objects (hairpins, socks)** or buildup.
- If clogged, clear the blockage before reassembling.

**If you find multiple clogs, reassemble and test before moving forward.**

---

### 3. Water Level Sensing System Malfunction

The **pressure hose and sensor** detect the water level in the machine.

#### **How to Diagnose:**
- Check the **pressure hose** for:
  - **Cracks** or **loose connections**
  - **Air leaks**, which may cause the machine to misread the water level
  - **Clogs**, which prevent proper water level detection
- On **front loaders**:
  - Blow air through the hose while it’s disconnected from the **air dome**.
  - If clogged, clear it or **replace it**.
- On **top loaders**:
  - Blow into the hose at the **pressure sensor** end.
  - If you hear an air leak or if the sensor does not click, **replace the hose**.

#### **Checking the Pressure Sensor:**
- Test **sensor resistance** with a multimeter (**21-23Ω** is common).
- If the sensor is **shorted (0Ω)** or outside range, **replace it**.

**For older machines with pressure switches:**
- Blow air into the switch – it should **click**.
- Use a **multimeter** to check continuity.
- If the switch is defective, **replace it**.

---

### 4. Wiring Harness and Connector Problems

#### **How to Diagnose:**
- Check **wiring connections** for the **pump and pressure sensor**.
- Inspect areas where wires may **flex** (look for breaks or loose connections).
- If all components check out, **reconnect all wiring** and test the washer.

#### **Next Steps:**
- If the wiring harness is faulty, **replace or repair it**.
- If wiring is intact, move to the **control board check**.

---

### 5. Timer Failure (Older Machines)

For **mechanical timer washers**, a faulty **timer motor** or worn **contacts** may cause drainage failure.

#### **How to Diagnose:**
- Try **manually advancing** the timer.
- If the cycle resumes, the timer contacts may be faulty.
- If the timer fails to engage the pump circuit, **replace the timer**.

---

### 6. Main Control Board

If all other components check out, the issue may be with the **control board**.

#### **Final Steps:**
- Inspect for **burnt components** or damaged traces.
- If other components work correctly, **replace the control board**.

---

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you can systematically troubleshoot a **washing machine that won’t drain**. Start with the **simplest solutions** like **clogged hoses**, then move to **pump and sensor issues**, before considering **replacing major components** like the **control board**.



# Washing Machine Is Leaking

## First Steps

Shut off the water to the washing machine. It will help you to get everything dry, and you may notice that the wall-mounted shutoff valves leak when you are doing this. You have a few questions to ask once the water is off. When you are ready to search for a specific leak, turn the water back on.

### Where Does It Leak?
- Look carefully for where the source of the leak seems to be, front or rear for example. Dried mineral or detergent deposits or rusted areas can give a clue.
- It is essential to dry everything off first because then the leak is easier to spot.
- You may even notice things like the location of the moisture as you are drying the machine.

### When Does It Leak?

#### If the machine leaks constantly:
- This points to a leak that is under constant pressure, usually at the rear of the machine.
- Check the **valves, hoses, and connections** that supply water to the machine. Tighten them and check again.
- Watch carefully, as water can run down a hose from a leaking connection and mislead you about the leak location.
- Sometimes putting your hand around a hose will allow you to feel water running down from above.
- Check the **solenoid water valve** inside the machine. If the valve body is cracked or a seal has failed, replace it.
- If the machine fills with water even when shut off, this is a failed solenoid valve that needs to be replaced.

#### If the machine leaks only when running:
- **Does it leak when the machine is filled with water?**
  - This could be due to **overfilling**, causing overflow onto the floor (especially in top-load machines).
  - It may also be a problem with the **solenoid valve or internal hoses**.
  - A **detergent dispenser clog or leak** can also be a cause.

- **Does it leak during the wash cycle?**
  - Possible causes include:
    - Overfilling and splashing (top-load machines with agitators)
    - **Tub seals failure** (significant in top-load machines, rear leakage in front-loaders)
    - **Cracked or disconnected water level tube**
    - **Failing door seal** (front-load machines)

- **Does it leak when the machine is draining?**
  - Most common failure due to large water volume and potential **lint clogs**.
  - If near the **front**, check the **pump and filters**.
  - If near the **rear**, check the **drain hose**.
  - If the wall behind the machine is wet, check for a **clog in home plumbing**.

---

## Causes

### 1. Pump and Filter Failures

#### Pump
- **Hose-related leaks**: Ensure hoses are secure and use clamps if necessary.
- **Cracked pump body**: Remove and inspect closely.
- **Worn-out seals**: Look for leaks at the drive shaft.
- **Cracked or disconnected bellows hose**: Will cause continuous leaks during operation.

#### Filter
- **Cracked or detached hoses**: Replace any damaged hoses.
- **Leaks after filter cleaning**: Reinstall properly.
- **Cracked filter housing or lid**: Replace if damaged.

### 2. Clogged Drain Hose
- **Check for clogs**, especially downstream of the anti-siphon.
- **Inspect for cracks**, particularly in corrugated plastic hoses.
- **Check home plumbing**: A partially clogged pipe may overflow when draining.

### 3. Overfilling
- **Top-loaders**: Open the lid to check water levels.
- **Check for excessive detergent use**, which can cause overflows.
- **Test the pressure tube** for clogs by blowing through it.
- **Check the pressure switch/sensor** for proper operation.

### 4. Tub Seal Failure
- **Signs of a leak**: Splash lines inside the machine or leakage below the tub center.
- **Remove cabinet pieces to observe leaks directly**.
- **If confirmed, replace the seal**.

### 5. Internal Leaks

#### Detergent Dispenser Damage
- **Cracked or improperly installed dispensers** will leak when in use.
- **Clogged dispenser hoses**: Remove, clean, and reattach.
- **Detached dispenser hoses**: Reattach or replace.

#### Solenoid Valve Cracked
- **Check for improperly installed hoses** or cracks in the valve body.
- **Inspect clamps** to avoid overtightening plastic components.
- **Check for failed seals near coils**.

### 6. Door Seal Failure (Front-Load Machines)
- **Seal may be out of place**.
- **Dirty seals prevent proper sealing**.
- **Look for tears or punctures**; if found, replace the seal.

### 7. Faulty Drum Vent
- **Use HE detergent** to prevent excessive suds.
- **Ensure correct detergent amounts** to avoid vent leaks.
- **Check machine leveling** using the manufacturer’s instructions.
- **Remove and inspect the vent valve** for proper operation.


# Washing Machine Has No Water

## Causes

### 1. No Power

An embarrassing moment, but embarrassing is also cheap!

- First just be sure it's all the way plugged in. Older non-electronic machines can often give no real indication that they are unplugged.
- Also check the circuit breaker for the laundry outlet. Maybe something tripped the breaker and it wasn't reset.
- If you find one of these problems, see if the machine will operate properly. Try running a spin cycle. If it starts, you know that's good. See if the machine has water now; if not, keep going.

### 2. Water Supply Is Off

Another embarrassing moment, but sometimes we forget that we or someone else shut the valves off.

- Look carefully at the valves. Do they have straight lever handles, or do they have round handles?
- If they have lever handles, make sure the handle is in line with the outlet of the valve. They should only turn one-quarter turn as they are ball valves.
- If they have round handles, they are likely globe, gate, or angle stop valves and will take multiple turns to turn off and on. Try turning them counterclockwise.
- Many water heater installations will have valves for both hot and cold at the water heater. Make sure all valves at the water heater are on.

### 3. Clogged Filter Screens

Your machine will have filter screens located in the water inlet connections of the machine. There will also frequently be screens on the water supply hoses. These screens can become clogged and make the water flow slowly or not at all.

#### To check them:

1. **Turn off the water supply.**
2. **Disconnect the hoses at both ends.** (Have a rag or a bucket handy to catch the water.)
3. **Inspect the filter screens** on the hoses and clean or replace them if necessary.
4. **Inspect the screens on the machine.** If they are dirty, clean them; if broken, replace them.
5. **Reconnect all the hoses**, turn the water back on, and test the machine.

### 4. Faulty Lid Switch

- If the lid switch on your machine might be keeping it from filling, a quick check is to run a spin-only cycle.
- If the machine will run, then the lid switch is good.
- If not, investigate the switch, as it is a common failure point, especially on older machines.
- [Here is a guide for replacing the lid switch on an older machine.](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Kenmore+80+Series+Washing+Machine+Lid+Switch+Replacement/)

### 5. Water Inlet Solenoid Valve Failure

The most common problem preventing your machine from filling with water is a **failed solenoid valve**. Signs of failure include:

- The machine fills with **only hot** or **only cold** water.
- Water fills **slowly**.

#### Steps to diagnose:

1. **Try filling the machine with cold water only.** If nothing happens, the cold water solenoid may be bad.
2. **Try filling with hot water only.** If nothing happens, the hot valve might be faulty.
3. **Unplug the machine, shut off water, and disconnect hoses.**
4. **Locate the solenoid valve** (where water hoses connect to the machine).
5. **Test the solenoid coils** with a multimeter set to ohms:
   - If over ~1,500Ω or very low (0Ω), replace the valve.

### 6. Water Level Control / Pressure Switch Failure

Your machine may think it is **already full** and refuse to fill with water. This issue is linked to the **water level control** (pressure switch or sensor).

#### Steps to diagnose:

1. **Locate the pressure switch** – a small device with a rubber hose attached.
2. **Check the pressure tube for clogs** by blowing through it gently.
3. **For older machines:**
   - If it has a knob for adjusting the water level, remove and test continuity using a multimeter.
   - If there is no continuity, replace the switch.
4. **For newer machines:**
   - The sensor is electronic and usually tested via self-diagnosis mode.

### 7. Faulty Control Board

If everything else checks out and the machine still won’t fill, the issue may be a **faulty control board**.

- This is a costly component, so consider consulting an appliance technician before replacing it.

# Washing Machine Door Is Locked  

## First Steps  

We are starting with you looking at your locked washing machine. First of all, there are a few questions to answer.  

### Is your machine a top loader?  
If not, go to the next question.  

Most top-load machines don't have a latch device that is released by pulling a handle. They use the weight of the lid to hold it closed.  

#### Your best bets for releasing the door:  
- Unplug and wait 5 minutes.  
- Gently bang on the door near the latch location.  
- Try to alternately lift and push in gently on the door near the latch location. Do this for a minute or so.  
- Try to remove the top of the machine to gain access to the latch. This is often complicated on a top-load machine and usually involves removing the control console, and then releasing the top. You may find that it's better to have a service person do this.  
- If you get in, you should be able to manually release the latch.  

### Is your machine still full of water?  
Some machines will not unlock the door if they aren't pumped out first.  

#### Steps to drain your machine:  
- Many front-load machines have filters that are located down low on the front of the machine. These can be opened carefully to allow the machine to drain.  
- Some machines will have a drain tube in the same spot, which can simplify the process.  
- You may be able to use a wet-dry vac at the filter opening (or the drain tube) to rapidly remove the water. **Be careful**, as the vacuum may damage seals if applied incorrectly.  
- If draining the machine allows the door to unlock, the issue is likely the pump, which should be replaced.  

### Does your washer have a handle on the door that moves a latch hook?  
- If the handle mechanism is broken (it will likely be floppy when operated), you will need to use alternative methods to get the door open. See [Releasing the Latch](#releasing-the-latch).  

### Does your washing machine have a lock mechanism that releases when the machine turns off?  
- Some machines have a delay before unlocking. Wait **5 minutes** and try again.  
- If the door is still locked, try **tapping the door near the latch** to help release it.  
- If the machine still does not unlock, continue to the next steps.

## Releasing the Latch  

There are several methods for releasing the latch on your machine. Some should not be used on certain machines as they can cause damage.  

### The String Method  
This method involves threading a string or cord around the door to form a loop and pulling it to release the latch.  

#### Steps:  
1. Use a **strong string**, such as fishing line, a nylon guitar string, or a small diameter insulated wire.  
2. Thread the string around the door and position it against the latch.  
3. Pull firmly in the correct direction to release the latch (this depends on the way the handle normally operates).  
4. Apply **gentle inward pressure** on the door while pulling the string to help release the latch.  

### The Card Method  
This method works for catches that move toward the hinges.  

#### Steps:  
1. Use a **stiff plastic card** (like a credit card or gift card).  
2. Insert the card between the door and the washer frame, near the latch.  
3. Push the card **toward the hinges** to disengage the latch.  

### Removing the Top Panel  
If other methods fail, you may need to access the latch mechanism from inside the machine.  

#### Steps:  
1. **Unplug the washer.**  
2. Remove the screws at the back of the machine.  
3. Slide the top panel toward the rear and lift it off.  
4. Locate the **latch mechanism** and release it manually using a screwdriver, Allen wrench, or release ring.

## Temporary Workarounds  

If replacing the latch immediately is not possible, you can create a temporary workaround:  

- **Install a flexible cord loop** around the latch hook and lead it outside the door for easy manual release.  
- This may work as a short-term solution until you replace the faulty latch.  

---

## Causes  

### 1. Faulty Handle (Movable Catch)  
If the handle still moves the catch but does not fully release it:  
- The handle or latch is **likely worn** and should be replaced.  
- Temporary fixes include using **the string or card method** until the part is replaced.  

### 2. Faulty Catch (Fixed or Movable Catch)  
- The **catch may be bent**, preventing proper release.  
- If it is bent, **replace it** and check for door misalignment.  

### 3. Faulty Door Hinges  
- **Loose, corroded, or bent hinges** can prevent the latch from aligning properly.  
- Inspect and **tighten or replace** as needed.  

### 4. Faulty Latch Mechanism  
Signs of a failing latch mechanism:  
- The machine refuses to lock or unlock.  
- **Error codes like DL** appear.  
- The latch hums or buzzes but fails to release.  

A **damaged latch** from forced opening or slamming the door should be replaced.  

### 5. Faulty Water Level Sensor  
- If the sensor **falsely detects water**, the door will remain locked.  
- **Check the tube** running from the drum to the sensor for clogs.  
- **Blow air through the tube** to clear blockages.  

### 6. Faulty Control Board  
- If all other components check out, the control board may **fail to send the unlock signal**.  
- This is **less common but costly** to repair.  
- **Consult a technician** before replacing the board.
